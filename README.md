# MaAst-Portal
A Mathematics and Astronomy portal created as part of ITWS -2 project (sem 2)

In this project, we intend to build a Semi-Formal chatting platform for maths and Astronomy Geeks and Learners. Chats are publically visible but only registered user get to participate in the chat. Typically, a user posts a question or asks follow-up questions or replies to questions in the group.

We wish to integrate this Web-App with many theorems and also scientific/ astronomical dictionary, so that any user can reference them without leaving the application.
